                <p>
                    The need for statewide democratic socialist organizing right now is urgent:
                    Already our enemies in the billionaire class are aiming to bust teacher unions by putting pro-charter and pro-voucher propositions on the ballot for next November.
                    If we're going to beat back their profit-driven privatization agenda, we need to organize on their level.
                    The wealthy few in California have been hoarding the vast wealth that California workers have created for decades.
                    Letâ€™s organize the majority to take it back!

                    The California DSA State Council is an 85-member body made up of delegates from California-based DSA chapters.
                    Every chapter in the state has been allocated a number of delegates based on their membership as of November 2021.
                    See the allocation for the inaugural meeting <a href="/delegates.html">here</a>.
