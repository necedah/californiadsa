          This vision document was ratified by the California DSA Exploratory Committee on January 16, 2021,
          and served as the basis for the construction of the <a href="/bylaws.html">California DSA bylaws.</a>

          <h1 class="display-4">Democratic Structure</h1>
          <p class="lead">We want to build a statewide structure that is responsive to members across the state and ensures accountability for the statewide organization.
          </p>
          <hr class=my-4/>
          <ul>
            <li>Proportional representation for chapters</li>
            <li>Enfranchise small chapters by requiring every chapter have a representative even if they are below threshold number for a representative</li>
            <li>Requiring representatives from at least a third of chapters statewide to pass substantive proposals</li>
            <li>State organization has no power to require any individual chapter to take any action; local chapters retain autonomy</li>
            <li>Smaller group of elected leaders who take on specifically delineated responsibilities to ensure functioning of statewide organization</li>
            <li>Democratic governance of existing California DSA Political Action Committee and any future statewide resources</li>
            <li>Chapters democratically determine their own selection structure for statewide representatives</li>
            <li>The vision for CA DSA representatives' participation is that it will not be onerous. CA DSA may set a maximum number of meetings per year, allowing those with limited time to commit to organizing work to participate in the larger body</li>

          <hr class=my-4/>
          <ul>
            <li>The statewide organization will establish lasting infrastructure, build institutional memory, and ensure continuity for CA DSA members to tap into to learn from past experiences and quickly acclimate to the nuances of California politics. </li>
            <li>CA DSA will maintain relationships with labor unions and progressive organizations in order to strategically collaborate on statewide campaigns. </li>
            <li>We will establish a clear process for endorsements and garner broad support for coordinated statewide and regional campaigns that bring us in common struggle with working-class and progressive organizations. </li>
            <li>The statewide organization can develop clear internal- and external-facing communications and messaging on news, issues, and campaigns that have statewide implications. </li>

          <h1 class="display-4">Growing and Strengthening Chapters</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            Over the past five years, DSA has grown from a few scattered chapters to over 200 local groups nationwide.
            Resources and support for national structures tasked with supporting new OCs and small chapters have not been able to keep up with this growth.
            California shares a single, vastly overworked field staffer with seven other states.
            As a result, many small chapters do not receive basic organizer training or sufficient support in getting off the ground, and new OCs often struggle to get through the new chapter pipeline.
            A statewide organization can help chapters across California by providing another conduit to our national organization, collaboration with more established chapters, and outward-facing campaigns for chapters to plug their members into.
          </p>
          <hr class=my-4/>
          <ul>
            <li>Administering state trainings and connecting chapters with national trainings on basic organizing skills like list work, recruitment, meeting facilitation, and managing social media.</li>
            <li>Providing more localized administration and support for existing national projects, like the Growth and Development Committee mentorship program, the new chapter pipeline, and socialist organizer trainings â€“ without recreating those processes from scratch.</li>
            <li>Working with more established chapters on skill shares, cross chapter observation, and other forms of direct support.</li>
            <li>Developing new and growing chapter capacities through shared work on collaborative campaigns. Growing chapters will play a decisive role in shaping and developing the campaigns undertaken by the statewide organization.</li>
            <li>Liaise with student leaders and YDSA coordinators in order to empower campus chapters to implement campus-specific organizing tactics as part of statewide democratically-selected campaigns.</li>
            <li>Liaise with organizing committees in order to expedite the pipeline to chapter formation.</li>
